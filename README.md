# CaesarIA 0.5

Work for CaesarIA began in 2009, it was a wide screen mod for Caesar III. In 2012 development moved to a standalone game with its own engine. In 2014, the game was released in steam, but still open-source software. It is an open-source remake of the popular citybuilder/economic strategy - Caesar III, videogame by Empressions Games. Now, CaesarIA is still in development phase, which means an early experimental stage. It is playable, and you can already download and test the game, but some features yet still missing. When CaesarIA will be released? It is very hard to quetion. Even after we are done implementing all the features, we will want to continue work for new features and testing. Information about release will be posted.


## Development

CaesarIA does not require any specific frameworks - all the frameworks we need are placed in the game repository. The game engine used is a patched version of SDL2, which is also packaged as part of game. You may need to install gcc or any compiler to be able to build game.
We use "cmake" for creating configs and building the game.

It's also been tested on a variety of other tools on
Windows/Mac/Linux.
